# My ML Project

This project uses a machine learning model to predict house prices.

## Project Setup

The project uses MLOps techniques like version control, containerization with Docker, CI/CD with Jenkins, workflow management with Apache Airflow, data version control with DVC, and experiment tracking with MLflow.

## Repository Structure

Here is a basic structure of the repository:

```bash

```

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd my_ml_project`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Build and run Docker image: `docker build -t my-app .` and `docker run -p 4000:80 my-app`
5. Start Airflow web server: `airflow webserver`

The model can be trained by running the ML pipeline with Apache Airflow.
